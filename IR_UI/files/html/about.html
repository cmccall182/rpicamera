    <h3><strong>Server by Brian Capowski</strong></h3>
    <h2><strong>About:</strong></h2>
    <p><em>This server is a basic HTML/Javascript server with a python backend which allows the user to manipulate the 
	raspberry PI associated with it, such that the box it is contained in does not need to be opened to harvest its
	data. It is fairly self explanatory: On the home page are two buttons to halt the data gathering processes and to start
	those processes, respectively. On the stream page, you can open a stream in a window to aim the camera, but data is NOT
	being gathered in this mode. You must hit the button underneath the stream to finish the aiming mode and begin data
        gathering. On the Get Data page, you may download different quantities of data. Keep in mind that while the download
	is occurring, data is not being gathered.
